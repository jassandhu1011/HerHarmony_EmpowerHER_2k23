        <h1>Recipes to Support Your Cycle</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <p>Did you know that you can support your body by eating different foods depending on where you are in your menstrual cycle? Depending on which phase you are in (hint: there are four!), your body benefits from different nutrients! In today’s post, we are providing you with some of our favorite recipes for each phase of your menstrual cycle!</p>

        <div class="phase">
            <h2>Phase 1: Menstrual Phase</h2>
            <p>We are all more than likely to be familiar with the menstrual phase. The first day of bleeding is considered day one of your cycle. To support your body during this time, we turn to water-rich fruits and veggies to stay hydrated and also incorporate comfort foods (think: peanut butter and dark chocolate).</p>
            <h3>Recipes for the menstrual phase:</h3>
            <ul class="recipe-list">
                <li>Green mint chip smoothie</li>
                <li>Strawberry-cocoa smoothie</li>
                <li>Paleo banana carrot breakfast muffins</li>
                <li>Summer tomato and squash soup</li>
                <li>Cucumber tomato salad</li>
                <li>Cauliflower veggies bowl with chicken</li>
                <li>Teriyaki salmon with sesame veggies</li>
                <li>Paleo peanut butter chocolate chip cookies</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="phase">
            <h2>Phase 2: Follicular Phase</h2>
            <p>The follicular phase is the second phase of the menstrual cycle occurring around day six through day fourteen. You are likely feeling low on energy during this time, so we like to focus on energy-boosting foods such as iron and vitamin B12.</p>
            <h3>Recipes for the follicular phase:</h3>
            <ul class="recipe-list">
                <li>Savory Sweet Potato Breakfast Bowl</li>
                <li>Quinoa chia Pancakes</li>
                <li>Maple and beet spinach salad</li>
                <li>Easy pantry black bean burger</li>
                <li>Easy airfryer salmon</li>
                <li>Spaghetti and grass-fed meatballs</li>
                <li>Easy beef burgers</li>
                <li>Pumpkin chickpea blondies</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="phase">
            <h2>Phase 3: Ovulatory Phase</h2>
            <p>The Ovulatory phase is the shortest phase lasting between one to two days, generally around days 13-15. During this time, energy levels and mood are typically high, so we suggest focusing on quality proteins and fats while cutting back on carbohydrates.</p>
            <h3>Recipes for the ovulatory phase:</h3>
            <ul class="recipe-list">
                <li>Breakfast yogurt bowl</li>
                <li>Banana Paleo Pancakes</li>
                <li>Fresh summer salad</li>
                <li>Balsamic chicken with vegetables</li>
                <li>Simple roasted salmon and asparagus</li>
                <li>2 ingredient vegan whipped cream and berries</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="phase">
            <h2>Phase 4: Luteal Phase</h2>
            <p>Lastl, is the luteal phase which can last anywhere from 11 to 17 days. This time can often be attributed to PMS symptoms when energy is low and we tend to feel moody, irritable, bloated, and hungry! Because of this, we suggest eating light but OFTEN (every three to four hours) to help balance blood sugar. Additionally, we recommend incorporating starchy veggies along with protein and healthy fats to help combat cravings.</p>
            <h3>Recipes for the luteal phase:</h3>
            <ul class="recipe-list">
                <li>Sweet Potato Toast: 3 ways</li>
                <li>Spinach and Sweet Potato frittata</li>
                <li>Cashew butter and strawberry sprouted oatmeal recipe</li>
                <li>Roasted carrot and avocado salad</li>
                <li>Mini Turkey Sliders with Sweet potato bun</li>

        <h1>Ayurvedic Foods for the Monthly Cycle</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="content">
            <p>I was raised in India in the Vedic tradition, and I now live in the United States. Having almost half a century of observation of different societies, I reached the following conclusion: women all over the world need to learn to value themselves more. To nurture comes naturally to most women — just not themselves!</p>
            <p>A healthy body relies on the emotional, mental, and spiritual health of an individual. We were taught as children that disease was merely dis-ease, a physical manifestation of emotional, mental or spiritual discomfort. Too simplistic? Maybe. It does have a ring of truth to it, though.</p>
            <p><strong>Menstruation in the Vedic tradition</strong></p>
            <p>Nothing separates a man from a woman as boldly, sometimes as painfully, as clearly as the monthly cycle — your monthly period! Called "the curse" for a long time in the Western world, this was, and still remains, something too private to discuss for most women, especially in India.</p>
            <p>When I was growing up, this was introduced to me as a time of comparative rest. The body was carrying out its monthly cleansing ritual and it was my duty to help it, not hinder it in its job. How could I help? By giving it more rest, by curbing my natural activities as much as I comfortably could and not being involved in heavy activity of any kind. Going for a walk instead of playing a sport, eating on time and sleeping early to give the body time and energy to perform this ritual.</p>
            <p>This was also a time to nourish myself by eating light-to-digest, sattvic (pure), fresh, home-cooked food at regular intervals. To stay away from caffeine, too much sweet, too much salt; in other words, everything had to be in balance — and no fast food! The last was easy to accomplish, as India still had not seen the advent of fast food when I was growing up.</p>
            <p><strong>Follow an Ayurvedic diet during your monthly cycle</strong></p>
            <p>Here are some recipes that can provide benefit during this sometimes difficult time of the month:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mixed Greens for the Monthly Cycle</li>
                <li>Khichadi for the Monthly Cycle</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Khichadis and soups are good meals for this time of the month — they soothe and relax your digestive system.</p>
            <p>Do avoid cold foods and uncooked salads during this time.</p>
            <p>Stir-fried vegetables are also a good option. Try to have a small helping of any grain of your choice — barley, wheat, rice, or quinoa — with the vegetables to bring a balance to your meal.</p>
            <p>Remember to eat light, regular, balanced meals.</p>
            <p>When your daughter reaches this landmark in her life, it is time to educate her on how to live through this time on a monthly basis in a healthy manner. This way, when she is on her own, taking care of herself will come naturally to her. Introduce healthy eating a little at a time, if you face resistance, but don't give up. It is easier for daughters to follow what they have seen their mothers do, so lead by example!</p>
            <p>Take care of yourselves, all you wonderful women out there, so that you may have the energy to take care of everything else life brings to you. Remember to be kind to yourselves, especially during your monthly period.</p>

            <p>While fertility treatments and medicines can sometimes help regulate a cycle, they may not always be the preferred choice. In the absence of medical interventions, altering your diet is one of the safest ways to naturally regulate your cycle. Certain foods are known for their potential to induce menstruation naturally.</p>
            <p>For most women, periods usually occur like clockwork. However, there can be times when your period cycle is later than usual. High stress levels, irregular eating habits, a sedentary lifestyle, and hormonal changes can be contributing factors. Alternatively, there might be occasions when a woman wants to induce her periods earlier than usual.</p>
            <p>Here are some foods that can help induce periods faster naturally:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Papaya:</strong> Papaya is considered nature's remedy for period irregularities. It contains a rich source of carotene, which speeds up estrogen production, inducing periods. Papaya also causes contractions in the uterus, helping shed the uterine lining and bringing periods earlier. Pregnant women are advised to avoid papaya due to its ability to regulate menstruation.</li>
                <li><strong>Dates:</strong> Dates, being a rich source of iron, vitamin C, folate, and other vital minerals, can affect menstrual cycles positively. Regular consumption, especially soaked in milk, can impact menstrual cycles.</li>
                <li><strong>Jaggery:</strong> Jaggery is an ancient remedy to induce or regulate period cycles naturally. It boosts hemoglobin and iron production, helping induce menstruation. A combination of roasted horse gram and jaggery or a tea made with jaggery and fenugreek seeds can be beneficial.</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin-C Rich Foods:</strong> Foods rich in vitamin C increase estrogen production, reduce progesterone count, and smoothen the shedding of the uterine lining. Some fruits also generate heat in the body, which is beneficial for fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Parsley:</strong> Parsley contains properties that stimulate uterine contractions, promoting menstruation. Drinking parsley tea once or twice a day can be helpful.</li>
                <li><strong>Ginger:</strong> Ginger works as an 'emmenagogue,' inducing and regulating menstrual flow. It can be consumed in various forms, including chai, curries, or as a hot tea.</li>
                <li><strong>Turmeric:</strong> Turmeric, like ginger, helps regulate menstrual flow by increasing estrogen production and reducing progesterone levels. It also has antispasmodic effects, benefiting menstrual and reproductive health.</li>
                <li><strong>Nuts and Seeds:</strong> Almonds and walnuts, rich in fiber, protein, and Omega-3, induce heat and promote regular menstruation. Seed cycling, incorporating specific nuts and seeds in your diet, can help correct menstrual imbalances.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> While these foods are considered healthy for menstrual and reproductive health, they may not work for everyone. There is no scientific evidence to support these claims, but these foods might help relieve some menstrual problems. To regulate menstrual cycles in the long run, it is essential to address underlying issues, maintain physical activity, have a balanced diet, manage stress levels, and ensure adequate sleep.</p>

            <p>Balanced nutrition and a healthy diet can support your body in many ways. Whether you’re looking to improve your energy and mood, combat stress, or boost fertility, what you fuel your body with can make an impact. To help explain how nutrition can impact your body, we’ve recently interviewed Dr. Jennifer Tinder of Axia Women’s Health OB/GYN of Indiana and gained valuable insight from the conversation. Read on below for tips on how to leverage nutrition to stay healthy and achieve your goals.</p>

            <h2>Why do women’s nutritional needs differ from those of men?</h2>
            <p>Great question, and it’s very important to acknowledge that men and women have differing nutritional needs as a result of differences in their bodies. For example, hormonal changes associated with menstruation, childbearing, and menopause mean that women have a higher risk of anemia, osteoporosis, and various nutritional deficiencies. For this reason, it’s important for women to include foods rich in calcium, vitamin D, B vitamins, and iron in their diet to maintain bone health and prevent anemia. Women also tend to lose more lean muscle mass over time due to age and childbearing. Therefore, a regular exercise regimen that includes weight training and/or high-intensity workouts should be a part of your routine. If you’re not doing this now, it’s never too late to start!</p>

            <h2>How can busy women maintain energy throughout the day?</h2>
            <p>If you’re trying to maintain energy, the most important advice I can give is to never skip a meal. Regularly scheduled eating times can help with energy levels and boost your mood. The average recommended calorie intake is around 2,000 calories per day for women.</p>

            <p>Each woman has unique nutritional needs, but in general you need about 1-2g of protein daily for every kilogram you weigh. For a 130-lb. woman (58kg), that means taking in up to 116g of protein daily. Most people do not eat enough food just to maintain their daily nutritional needs. And, while I know it seems counterintuitive, especially if you are trying to lose weight, building muscle is important as it burns fat/calories and helps maintain normal bone health. You cannot build muscle without protein.</p>

            <p>Stress and anxiety are also big energy zappers, so to lower stress levels, try walking, listening to music, or talking to friends. It’s also easy to confuse hunger and fatigue with thirst, so make sure you are drinking plenty of water.</p>

            <h2>What nutritional tips do you recommend for women trying to conceive?</h2>
            <p>Any woman considering pregnancy should begin taking a prenatal vitamin daily, and should ensure this supplement contains folic acid, which helps prevent fetal brain and spinal cord abnormalities early in pregnancy. Additional supplements might be recommended, depending on your situation, so it’s always wise to consult with your physician.</p>

            <p>I also tell women to avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. If you have medical problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid disease, then it is essential to keep these under control prior to and during pregnancy to have the best outcomes. You can see your doctor regularly to help you with this.</p>

            <p>Finally, it’s worth noting that about 40 percent of fertility problems are on the male’s side, so encourage your partner to also avoid alcohol and nicotine, and to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>

            <h2>Can proper nutrition improve my PMS symptoms?</h2>
            <p>In short, yes. Because hormones fluctuate around the time of the menstrual cycle, many women experience bloating, cramping, fatigue, and mood swings. Some easy nutritional remedies include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>For addressing bloating/backache/cramps: Approximately 7 days before your cycle, reduce your sugar and alcohol intake, and increase your protein intake. Also target the following: Omega 3 fatty acids (1g), Magnesium (200mg), Zinc (45mg) and Aspirin (81mg).</li>
                <li>For headache: Hydrate well, and eat foods high in nitric oxide, such as beets and leafy greens.</li>
                <li>For cravings: Increase your intake by 100-200 calories with carbs.</li>
                <li>For sleep disturbances: Try a glass of cold, tart cherry juice before bed, or Melatonin.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Of course, be sure to check with your doctor regarding any new supplements before trying them on your own.</p>
